# java-fundamentals

**Author**: Motasim Al-Azzam


## Overview

This project is dedicated to practicing Java fundamentals. The first function is called **pluralize** that accepts a word and a number and returns a string with the word pluralized with an “s” if the number is zero, or greater than one.

The second function is called **flipNHeads** that accepts an integer n and flips coins until n heads are flipped in a row. Simulate coin flipping by choosing a random number between 0 and 1. Numbers below .5 are considered tails. Numbers at and above .5 are considered heads.

The third function is called **clock** that uses Java’s built-in LocalDateTime object to constantly print out the current time to the console, second by second. The program should run until someone manually kills it with CTRL-C or presses the “stop” button in their IDE.

## Architecture

The programing language used to build this project is Java.
